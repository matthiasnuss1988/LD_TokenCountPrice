Via the Siegert relation we get

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:g2spatial1}
g^{(2)}(\boldsymbol{r}_1, \boldsymbol{r}_2)=1+\hat{Q}_0\Big|\dfrac{2J_1(a\xi)}{a\xi}\Big|^2,
\end{equation}

with the first order Bessel function $J_1(x)$ and the Fourier frequency

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:g2spatial2}
\xi=\dfrac{\pi}{\lambda z}|\boldsymbol{r}_1-\boldsymbol{r}_2|.
\end{equation}

Based on that, we define the coherence radius $|\boldsymbol{r}_1-\boldsymbol{r}_2|=\rho_c$, as the
distance between the first root of $J_1$ and the central peak at
$|\boldsymbol{r}_1-\boldsymbol{r}_2|=0$.We find the first root at $x =3.8317$, and hence

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:g2spatial3}
a\dfrac{\pi}{\lambda z}\rho_c\stackrel{!}{=}3.8317 \rightleftarrows \rho_c\approx 1.22\dfrac{\lambda z}{a}.
\end{equation}

We yield the extension of the coherence cell in space $\rho_c$, where the cell and thus the length
of maintained coherence properties extend over the distance z.This finding is important for the
detector placement in correlation measurements.For instance if ${r}_1$ (distance of detector $D_1$)
is fixed in the detection plane and the position of detector $D_2$ is varied along the green arrow
in \cref{fig:cittert}, via \cref{eq:g2spatial1} we get the coherence loss due to an out of center
sampling in the coherence cell.


\subsubsection{Temporal Coherence}\label{sec:temporal_coherence}
A useful tool to quantify temporal coherence is the (first-order) coherence time $\tau_c$ or the
coherence length $l_c$.Within these parameters, the light is said to be coherent.Thus, the phase and
amplitude of the light can be deduced at a certain position or time, with a high degree of certainty
from a known position or time \cite{fox_quantum_2006}.In ideal interference experiments the used
light is monochromatic, because interference patterns are built by summing up amplitudes of
light.Only light of the same wavelength or at least of a very narrow interval shows phases with
clear relations at different points.With increasing optical bandwidth, interference effects become
less visible.Therefore, first order coherence is indirect proportional to the optical
bandwidth.Thus, the first order coherence time is $\tau_c^{(1)}=1/{\Delta\nu}$, with $\Delta\nu$ the
frequency bandwidth of light.The coherence time can be expressed by the wavelength bandwidth
$\Delta\lambda$ via $c= \lambda\nu$ with the speed of light c:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:coherence1}
\Delta\nu=\dfrac{\partial\lambda}{\partial\nu}\Big|_{\lambda_0}\Delta\nu=-\dfrac{c}{\lambda^2_0}\Delta\lambda.
\end{equation}

Here $\lambda_0$ is the central wavelength and the negative sign can be omitted since $\Delta\nu$ or
$\Delta\lambda$ have no direction.
Using $\tau_c^{(1)}=1/{\Delta\nu}$, we obtain the coherence time in dependence of the wavelength
bandwidth:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:coherence2}
\tau_c^{(1)}=\dfrac{\lambda^2_0}{c\Delta\lambda}
\end{equation}

The broader the optical bandwidth, the shorter the coherence time.The terms "coherence" and
"correlation" are strongly related, and thus the coherence time can also be called the correlation
time.\\
For real light sources, there exists also a second order coherence time $\tau_c^{(2)}$, because of
the lifetime of the molecule or an artificial process, leading to additional coherence properties
(cf.\cref{sec:rpm}).
For long-lived molecular signals the \textit{ns}-lifetime dominates the coherence time and in a
correlation measurement we measure $\tau_c^{(2)}$.Though, for understanding mechanisms and
influences on coherence, we restrict our discussion to linewidth-limited coherence $\tau_c^{(1)}$,
whereas the same rules also apply for $\tau_c^{(2)}$ and we simply write $\tau_c$, where both
$\tau_c^{(1)}$ and $\tau_c^{(2)}$ can apply.\\


\subsection{Temporal Second-Order Correlation}
To understand the expectations from a time tagging correlation experiment, we define the temporal
$g^{(2)}$ function as a criterion for enhanced coherence\footnote{The coherence time $\tau_c$
(cf.\cref{sec:coherence}) is a measure of the steepness of the $g^{(2)}$ function in the correlation
regime and is related to the area and the width (\cref{sec:Timeestimation,sec:lineshapes}) of the
peak.} in the classical intensity picture.
