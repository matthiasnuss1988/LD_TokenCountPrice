\cref{eq:Normderivation2,eq:Normderivation3}) is a good criterion to judge whether the baseline is
stable during measurements.Moreover, different noise sources can lead to increased noise around zero
of a $g^{2}$ measurement and limit the achievable signal contrast, such as the mobile communication
frequencies $\SI{800}{\MHz}$ and $\SI{950}{\MHz}$, or a nonlinearity of the \ac{TDC} device
\cite{zmija_design_2018}.Particularly we look into cross correlation measurements evaluated in the
range of $\pm\SI{500}{\ns}$ around zero, since this is the range where we evaluate
antibunching/bunching properties usually.To evaluate the baseline and connected noise we used a
\ac{CW} \ac{TiSa} laser source with $\lambda_0\approx \SI{750}{\nm}$ in the \ac{HBT} setup and test
different parameter combinations for the \ac{TDC}.Hence, we check whether the baseline is affected
by these parameter combinations ($\dot{N}_\mathrm{start}$, $\dot{N}_\mathrm{stop}$,
$\tau_\mathrm{bin}$ and overall measurement time $T_t$), according to the theory:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:g2_noise_floor_M}
|M|=\dot{N}_\mathrm{start}\cdot \dot{N}_\mathrm{stop}\cdot\tau_\mathrm{bin}\cdot T_t,\quad\mathrm{and}\quad \sigma_\mathrm{g^{(2)}}=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{|M|}}
\end{equation}

The initial parameter combination is $\tau_\mathrm{bin}=\SI{1}{\ns}$,
$\dot{N}_\mathrm{start}+\dot{N}_\mathrm{stop}\approx \SIrange{500}{550}{\kHz}$, and
$T_t\approx\SI{30}{\s}$ in \cref{fig:g2_noise}b, where we varied one parameter each in
\cref{fig:g2_noise}a, c and d, respectively.This is a conscious arrangement to test the baseline
normalization to result in a perfect 1 everywhere in the $g^{(2)}$ spectrum, only influenced by
statistical shot noise fluctuations.
We display the time trace of the actual count rate of the start and stop detector (black and red
triangles), as well as the coincidence-histogram weighted count rate (solid lines) in the upper
panels of \cref{fig:g2_noise}.

In the lower panels the absolute number of coincidence events (black lines) are displayed on the
right side of each panel and $g^{(2)}$ data (blue) as well as the average (red) is shown on the left
side.As expected from \cref{eq:g2_noise_floor_M}, the fluctuations $\sigma_\mathrm{g^{(2)}}$ of the
baseline decrease, if an initial parameters increases.We evaluate the means $|M|$ and standard
deviations $\sigma_\mathrm{g^{(2)}}$ of the experimental coincidence histogram counts in the
illustrated ranges of the panels and compare the results with the theoretical expectation, using the
parameter combinations.The results are recorded in \cref{tab:g2_noise_compare}.\\
We see the theoretical baselines lie within a $1-\sigma$ uncertainty of the experimental values and
deviate by a maximum of \SI{2}{\percent} from the theory.Also the fluctuations of the baselines are
similar and deviate by a maximum of 5\% from the theory.
That means the $g^{2}$ values of the baseline are stable and fit quite well the theory for all
observed parameter combinations and the fluctuations of the baseline are Poisson-limited.Thus, in
the current \ac{HBT} setup we can achieve the theoretical possible signal contrast and further noise
contamination in $g^{2}$ is neglected.


\subsection{Random Phase Modulation}\label{sec:rpm}
As we have pointed out, in an \ac{HBT} experiment, one experiences visibility reduction, e.g., due
to spatial misalignment and temporal coherence loss.
