Thus, even if we take an upper limit for the spectral with of the laser $\Delta \lambda
=\SI{1}{\nm}$ (cf.\cref{fig:GGD_krot_tauc_fit}), we expect a maximum of \SI{4}{\percent} visibility
reduction due to wavelength diversity.Wavelength diversity is also a reason why for a pulsed
\textit{fs}-laser, we are unable to thermalize the light, since then
$\Delta\lambda=\lambda_0^2/c\tau_p$, with $c$ the speed of light and $ \tau_p\approx \SI{13}{\fs}$
the pulse width.\\
The temporal properties of the rotating \Ac{GGD} are more delicate.In the stationary case, the
speckle pattern in \cref{fig:GGD_schematics} does not change with time and the coherence properties
are determined by the laser ($g^{(2)}\approx 1$).\
Still, rotating the \ac{GGD}, the position of the illuminated spot on the glass is changed.
The intensity fluctuations, with $\bar{n}$ and $ \sigma_n$ at the detectors will change.Following,
the imprinted temporal correlation in a speckle decrease until the disc completed a rotation cycle,
thereafter only redundant information is generated.Thus the correlation time is inversely
proportional to the rotation rate of the disc ($\tau_c \propto 1/k_\mathrm{rot}$) and can be
adjusted.\\
Utilizing this technique, we generate a \ac{PTLS} by transmission of the single frequency
\SI{749.5}{\nm} TiSa laser through the rotating \ac{GGD}.This method is suitable to simulate a light
source with low intensity and a very long coherence time
\cite{martienssen_coherence_1964,estes_scattering_1971} in the range of \SI{1}{\us}--\SI{1}{\ms}.The
laser power was adjusted by a neutral density filter, then focused on the rotating disk using a
plano-convex lens.to keep the frequency stable, we used a feedback loop where a hall sensor measured
the actual number of revolutions and an algorithm adjusted the current of the motor
appropriately.Reducing the stray room light was important for measuring a long coherence time.~The
product of the average rate and coherence time has to be small($\dot{N}\tau_c\ll1$), to avoid dead
time effects lowering $g^{(2)}$.That is, the longer coherence time requires a lower photon rate.On
the other hand, the detected photon counts of the light source must exceed the background photon
counts, which amount about \SI{5}{\percent} of the detected photon rate of \SI{300}{\kHz} in our
case.\\
We varied the coherence time of the \ac{PTLS} with $k_\mathrm{rot}$ to compare the deduced coherence
time with the theoretical predication in \cref{fig:GGD_curves}.The barely visible coincidence
histogram (black) manifests a stable scaling factor of $\approx 1.6$ to the second-order
correlation.Further on, $g^{(2)}(0)>1$ for all $k_\mathrm{rot}$ indicates stable thermalization of
the light field.We trace the \ac{FWHM} for $k_\mathrm{rot}$=\SI{300}{\Hz} to
$k_\mathrm{rot}$=\SI{50}{\Hz} (black dotted line), observing an increase of the FWHM with
$k_\mathrm{rot}$.For $k_\mathrm{rot}$=\SI{0}{\Hz}, we observe no thermalization, but a straight
line, as expected for the Poisson result of a coherent laser source.
The coherence times $\tau_c^{(2)}$ of the \ac{PTLS} can be derived from a one-step reconvolution fit
using \cref{eq:totalvis3}.
The random phase modulation not only converts the light source to be pseudo-thermal, but also
broadens the linewidth, where both, a Gaussian and a Lorentzian Lineshape, can apply.As illustrated
in \cref{fig:GGD_curves} (red lines), the Lorentzian exponential decay curve is more suitable than
the Gaussian line shape.It is due the backscattering random phase modulation is similar to the
mechanism of collision broadening, which broadens the spectrum to a Lorentzian shape.\\
For monochromatic light with negligible linewidth $\Delta\lambda\approx 0$, the coherence time of
the \ac{PTLS} is proportional to the inverse of the rotating frequency \cite{estes_scattering_1971}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GGD_krotsimple}
\dfrac{1}{\tau_c^{(2)}}=m\cdot k_\mathrm{rot}=\dfrac{4\sqrt{\pi}r}{d}k_\mathrm{rot};\qquad\tau_c^{(2)} k_\mathrm{rot}=\dfrac{1}{m}=\textrm{const},
\end{equation}

with r as the radius from the disc center to the spot with spot diameter $d$.
