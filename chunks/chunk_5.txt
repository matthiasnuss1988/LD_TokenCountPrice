Thus, the expression for $c_N(\tau)$ in the case of an ideal spectrum ($c_N(\tau)=g^{(2)}$) is as
follows.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:g2finite4}
g^{(2)}=c_N(\tau)=N\dfrac{\sum_\mathrm{i=1}^\mathrm{N} I(t_i)I(t_i+\tau)}{\Big(\sum_\mathrm{i=1}^\mathrm{N} I(t_i)\Big)^2}.
\end{equation}

\Cref{eq:g2finite4} is also valid for the intensity $I(t_i)> 1$ of each time bin.As one expects
$c_N(\tau) = 1$ for $|\tau|\gg 0$.A way to normalize $c(\tau)$ is to calculate the mean value in a
range far beyond the correlation regime.\\
A fictional time difference histogram with several bins is displayed in \cref{fig:tailnorm}.The
histogram is normalized to the yellow baseline with an average count number per bin of $c(\tau)$ =
\num{200}, which is determined for $|\tau|\approx$ \SI{1}{\s}.Since the coincidence region around
$\tau=0$ is typically in the \si{ps} to \si{ns} range, the correlation signal is scaled and not
altered by the baseline in the "tail" region.
To compute the expected event number $\braket{I(t)}^2$ in the "tail" region, one can imagine a
correlation with the total measurement time $T_t$ and the total numbers of events $N_\mathrm{start}$
and $N_\mathrm{stop}$ in channel \num{0} or \num{1}.The maximum number of coincidences in the time
regime is $N_\mathrm{start}N_\mathrm{stop}$, as every photon from channel \num{0} can be compared to
a photon in channel \num{1}.In addition, large time differences near $T_t$ may not occur as
frequently as small ones.While the maximum deviation from the Poisson case (in the number of events
per bin) is around $\tau=0$, we see a linear decrease towards zero at $ \tau= \pm
T_t$.\Cref{fig:Normtriangle} sketches the expected event numbers for a super-Poisson light
source.The width of the boxes is typically in the sub-\si{\ns} range.Usually, the evaluation region
is only a few nanoseconds, whereas the measurement times are in the range of minutes or even
hours.Therefore, the effect of decreasing the number of events in the time-difference spectrum with
larger time differences is extremely small, and the fluctuations of the correlation should be the
fluctuation of the Poisson baseline, determined by M in the plot.
This value M can be derived geometrically by \cref{eq:Normderivation}, deduced from
\cref{fig:Normtriangle}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Normderivation}
N_\mathrm{start}N_\mathrm{stop}=\dfrac{1}{2}N_\mathrm{bins}|M| \underbracket{\Leftarrow}_\mathrm{super-Poisson}2\Delta_{0,\, T_t,\, M}\underbracket{\Rightarrow}_\mathrm{sub-Poisson}=\dfrac{1}{2}N_\mathrm{bins}|M|
\end{equation}

Note that for a sub-Poisson light source the value M is negative, which is why we use $|M|$ and the
area of the triangle is $|M|N_\mathrm{bins}-N_\mathrm{start}N_\mathrm{stop}$, where
$\Delta_\mathrm{0,T_t,\,|M|}$ is a triangle with corners at the origin, $|M|$ and $T_t$.Solved for
$|M|$ with $N_\mathrm{bins} = 2T_t/\tau_\mathrm{bin}$, we get the following:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Normderivation2}
|M|=\tau_\mathrm{bin}\dot{N}_\mathrm{start}\dot{N}_\mathrm{stop}T_t
\end{equation}

$\dot{N}_\mathrm{start,\, stop}= N_\mathrm{start,\, stop}/T_t$ are the (average) photo-electron
count rates.Note the normalization $|M|$ in \cref{eq:Normderivation2} comes out to be independent of
the light statistics.Consequently, the uncertainty of the Poisson baseline is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Normderivation3}
|\Delta M|=\sqrt{\tau_\mathrm{bin}\dot{N}_\mathrm{start}\dot{N}_\mathrm{stop}T_t}\quad\Rightarrow\quad\sigma_\mathrm{g^{(2)}}=\dfrac{|\Delta M|}{|M|}=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\tau_\mathrm{bin}\dot{N}_\mathrm{start}\dot{N}_\mathrm{stop}T_t}}
\end{equation}

In the picture of $g^{(2)}$, we normalize the time difference spectrum by dividing each bin by the
average number of coincidences, which is almost exactly $|M|$ in the evaluation region.We also note
that the total count rate product, which is not necessarily divided equally between both detectors,
underestimates $|M|$.The results are too large and unstable $g^{(2)}$ values, which we investigate
from a quantum statistical perspective in \cref{sec:beamsplittercorr}.
