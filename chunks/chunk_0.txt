\chapter{Coincidence-Based Second-Order Correlation}%\label{5_coincidence}

A method that is often used to determine whether any light source is a \ac{SPS} is the second-order
correlation function $g^{(2)}(t+\tau)$.Throughout this work, in most cases, we consider stationary
processes, so the dependence on the time $t$ is considered implicit, whereas the dependence on
$\tau$ is left explicit.


\section{Status-Quo}
One way to measure this correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ is by photon interferometry.Since
Amplitude interferometers like the Michelson interferometer have to deal with major challenges,
requesting the coherence of the light detected at the different telescopes, electromagnetic waves
must be detected with a precision smaller than the wavelength of the observed light at the two
detection points to still recognize the interference.Furthermore, light from different telescopes
has to be brought together with the same precision, making Michelson interferometry impractical and
very elaborate.


\subsection{The Hanbury Brown and Twiss Interferometer}
A way out of this dilemma is the \ac{HBT} experiment.~The experiment, initially invented by
Hanbury-Brown and Twiss in 1956, has the advantage of measuring the number of photons and their
correlated intensity fluctuations instead of amplitudes.Consequently, \ac{HBT} is insensitive to the
phase of electromagnetic waves.
The setup for such an experiment is very famous.An incoming photon beam is split into two by a 50:50
\ac{BS}.Both beams are directed to a single-photon detector like in our case two Perkin Elmer Si
\ac{APD}s (\ac{SPCM}-CD 2801 9380 Rev.G and \ac{SPCM}-AQR-13 11475).The electrical output signals of
the detectors are monitored by a \ac{TDC} which measures the time difference between the signals
from both detectors.


\subsection{Photon Time Tagging}
In this thesis, trigger thresholds (start--stop) are used to determine the arrival time of a photon
instead of sampling the signal.Using these trigger thresholds, a more
frequent time sampling/binning is possible than by a fix trigger sampling of the \ac{APD}
signal.When the signal from the start channel reaches the threshold, an event is recorded on the
start device, and the corresponding time is the specific time tag of a photon on a two-photon
histogram $c(\tau)$, indicated in \cref{fig:CorrelationShematics}.When $c(\tau)$ is enhanced at
$\tau$ = \num{0}, photons tend to arrive simultaneously at the two detectors, and photon
combinations with $\tau\approx$ \num{0} should exist more often than those with
$|\tau|>$\num{0}.This is an indicator for photon bunching, as occurs in photon streams from thermal
light sources.When observing a photon source with Poisson photon statistics, i.e., a laser,
$c(\tau)$ is independent of $\tau$.If the incoming light originates from a single-photon source, two
photons can't arrive simultaneously at both detectors and $c(0)$ = \num{0}.This means that no signal
will be measured for a time difference of zero.As we move away from zero, the function value
increases asymptotically in the Poisson case.


\subsection{The Wiener-Khinchin Theorem}\label{sec:Khinchin}
The Wiener--Khinchin theorem relates the temporal first-order correlation function $g^{(1)}(\tau)$
to the normalized power spectrum by Fourier transformation $\mathcal{F}(\omega)$ of the light
source.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:WienerForward}
\mathcal{F}(\omega)=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g^{(1)}(\tau)\exp{(i\omega \tau)}\partial\tau
\end{equation}

The back transformation can also be used to calculate the temporal function $g^{(1)}$ of the power
spectrum.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:WienerBackward}
g^{(1)}(\tau)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathcal{F}(\omega)\exp{(-i\omega \tau)}\partial\omega
\end{equation}


\subsection{The Siegert Relation}\label{sec:siegert}
Originally developed for thermal light, the Siegert relation relates the first- and second-order
correlation functions, assuming a large number of equivalent atoms emitting electromagnetic waves
that interfere with the observer \cite{classen_incoherent_2017}.
