We extracted the lifetime from $k_\mathrm{c,\, exp}$, where the inter photon delay has an upper
bound of $2\tau_f$ for spontaneous emission of a two-level molecule
\cite{maser_few-photon_2017}.With laser pumping, the power term lowers the inter-photon delay by
stimulated emission, which has to be corrected.


\subsubsection{Summary of the Procedure}\label{sec:summarydeconv}
\Cref{fig:g2_procedure} displays the procedure of the $g^{(2)}$- and lifetime mode.~We sample the
measurement in a timed loop from $s=1$ to $t$ and a time step of \SI{1}{\s}, until the end is
reached at $T_t$.During the measurement we read out a cumulative counter and coincidence
histogram.For the histogram we distinguish between the pulsed and \ac{CW} case.\\
For the pulsed case the raw histogram is cleaned up by moving the histogram along the time axis so
that the $m=0$ peak is centered at $\tau_0$.Furthermore, a linear baseline offset is removed.We then
split the histogram into sub-histograms for each pulse and calculate difference sub-histograms
utilizing the sub-histograms from the previous step $s$ and integrate the sub-histograms for every
pulse.We calculate the difference sub-histograms to be able to normalize correctly for temporal
bleaching trends in the actual count rate.\\
Moreover, from the cumulative counter we calculate the actual count rates of time step s and weight
the actual count rates with the sum over all difference sub-histograms from a time step s.In such a
way we generate a weighted rate for each time step s.~Next, we normalize the integrated difference
sub-histograms for each pulse with the weighted rate, for each time step s to correctly normalize
$g^{(2)}$ for arbitrary signal trends (cf.\cref{sec:g2_error_lifetime}).The resulting quantity has
the dimension of $\delta g^{(2)}$ for every step s and thus we have to sum these values up for all
steps s.\\
After $T_t$ is reached, we perform a one-step reconvolution (cf.\cref{sec:decon}) fit, utilizing the
jitter and visibility reducing factors.The actual jitter is interpolated from the power-dependent
jitter measurements in \cref{sec:powerjitter} by using a third-order fit and the sum of the weighted
count rates form start and stop detector.The visibility reducing factors were calculated beforehand,
as outlined in \cref{sec:g2_visibility}.
In the case of incident pulses without flat phase, e.g., featuring double pulses, a Lorentz-shaped
histogram fit can provide a clean signal instead of using the cumulative histograms for the
procedure.The correlation time is calculated from the pulse slopes using the lifetime procedure of
\cref{sec:lifetime}.Thereafter we perform a power correction due to stimulated emission upon laser
excitation \cite{beveratos_room_2002,treussart_photon_2001} to reveal $\tau_F$, which enters the
one-step reconvolution fit.The result is the intrinsic $g^{(2)}$ curve.\\
For \ac{CW} excitation, the difference histogram can be normalized directly, whereupon all other
evaluation steps are the same as for the pulsed case, except for the correlation time, which can be
obtained directly from the reconvolution fit, featuring more data points.\\
For the error calculation of $g^{(2)}$ we apply a more advanced error propagation technique,
considering covariance matrices.The reason is, the start and stop count rates are statistically
correlated by the \ac{BS} and the coincidence counts depend on the count rates as well.For the
corresponding error propagation rules see \cref{sec:g2_error_lifetime}.


\section{Continuous Wave Measurements}
We deploy the \ac{CW} methods for $g^{(2)}$ measurements to rate the noise contamination and
accuracy of the evaluation routines and the digital setup.
We check the Poisson baseline of the $g^{(2)}$ normalization and the fluctuations of the noise floor
for consistency with the theory.Furthermore, we use a home-built \ac{RPM} module to test the
coherence properties of the setup and the accuracy of the re-convolution routine.
We reconstruct $g^{(2)}(0)$ and $\tau_c$ using the re-convolution routine for digitized data on
\ac{SWCNT} and $WSe_2$ and compare the values with literature.
