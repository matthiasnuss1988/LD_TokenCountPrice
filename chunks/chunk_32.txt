The third measurement is influenced by temporal bleaching during the measurement, increasing
$g^{(2)}$ value, since for baseline normalization we still did not used weighted rates.From the
$k_c$ values, we determine the lifetime $\tau_f$ of the \acp{SWCNT} via the power correction in
\cref{eq:taufpump}.We get $\tau_{f,\,1}\textrm{\; to \;}\tau_{f,\,3}$ = \SIlist[list-units =
brackets]{0.44;0.66;0.57}{\ns}.These values agree with literature values, which are in the range of
several hundred picoseconds to about \SI{50}{\ns}.The short lifetimes indicate recombination at
vacancy centers \cite{zaumseil_luminescent_2022}\\
%Interestingly, whereas the values $\tau_f=\SIrange{5.71\pm0.38}{\ns}$ lie within the reported range
of several hundred picoseconds to about \SI{100}{\ns} \cite{ miyauchi_radiative_2009,
perebeinosRadiativeLifetimeExcitons2005, rao_anharmonic_2007, hagen_electronic_2004,
wangTimeresolvedFluorescenceCarbon2004}, they are an order of magnitude larger than the lifetimes
evaluated in \cref{sec:g2_exp_lifetimes}.

typically measured by TCSPC with an \ac{HBT} setup
\cite{miyauchiFemtosecondExcitationCorrelation2009}
%However, the TCSPC measurement is inadequate for the large diameter SWNTs d   0.8 nm because of
the limit of the sensitive range of Si-based single-photon counting avalanche photodiodes, and the
sensitivity and time-resolution of near IR streak cameras are low.Although frequency upconversion34
and Kerr gate18,35 methods provide excellent time-resolution, these methods involve relatively
complicated experimental setups.Hence, the development of alternatives has been eagerly anticipated
to measure the ultrafast PL dynamics in SWNTs in the near IR range with good time
resolution.\cite{miyauchiFemtosecondExcitationCorrelation2009}
In the initial setup, the \ac{HBT}-interferometer was unbalanced in terms of optical beam path
length.That is why, the path length difference $\Delta r$ between both detectors introduces
coherence loss.From the lifetimes, we determine the coherence lengths $l_\mathrm{c1}-l_\mathrm{c3}$
= \SIlist[list-units = brackets]{0.13;0.20;0.17}{\m}.The path length difference $\Delta r$ was
\SI{0.10}{\m}, which increases the measured $g^{(2)}(0)$ values, relative to $l_{c}$.Based on the
temporal coherence loss introduced by this path length difference, we calculate according to
\cref{sec:temp_coh_loss} $\nu_\mathrm{l_c}^\mathrm{Lorentz}$ = 0.46,~0.60 and 0.55.Consequently, the
intrinsic $g^{(2)}(0)$ values decrease to $g^{(2)}_{1}(0)$ = \num{0.20\pm0.1}, $g^{(2)}_{2}(0)$ =
\num{0.55\pm0.04} and $g^{(2)}_{3}$ = \num{0.71\pm0.03}, corresponding to a number of one to three
emitters in the microscope focus.
