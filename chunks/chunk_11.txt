In this section, we provide an in-depth analysis of the
individual parameters affecting $g^{(2)}$ in terms of shape and visibility.We distinguish between
irreversible and reversible visibility reduction.While the reduced visibility due to signal noise
and an uneven \ac{BS} ratio can be improved by longer sample statistics
(cf.\cref{sec:Timeestimation,sec:beamsplittercorr}), irreversible visibility reductions have to be
corrected compulsorily.\\
We reveal correction factors $\nu_\mathrm{vis}$ to extract the theoretical correlation function
$g^{(2)}_\mathrm{intrinsic}$ (abbreviated with $g^{(2)}(m,\,\tau)$, which describes the correlations
inherently present in the light field emitted by the light source, from $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{meas}$,
which represents the normalized correlation function that can actually be measured (abbreviated with
$C_N(m,\,\tau)$) with a given detection setup.\\
We start with the original correlation function, which can be based on the physical properties of
the light source, e.g., Doppler-(cf.\cref{eq:KhinchinExample27}) or impact-broadened
(cf.\cref{eq:KhinchinExample23}).Here, we assume that the light field consists of only one mode,
resulting in $g^{(2)}(0)$ = 0, 1, or 2 .In experiments even so, there is always the possibility that
more than one spatial and/or temporal mode is detected by the setup.Since single-photon counting
modules, such as an \ac{APD}, cannot distinguish between different modes, the correlation function
of the detected light field has reduced visibility.In this context, we introduce the definition of
visibility, which is a multiplicand of the normalized Mandel Q-Parameter.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vis}
\nu_\mathrm{vis}=\dfrac{C_N(0)-1}{\hat{Q}_0},
\end{equation}

representing the actual value of how far the (anti)-bunching peak in the second-order correlation
function exceeds its baseline of 1.
For the following analysis of the individual factors affecting $g^{(2)}$, we assume the current
visibility is the only influence on the correlation function.In \cref{sec:decon}, the effects of all
factors are summarized.


\subsubsection{Background Radiation}
In practice, it is impossible to shield the experimental setup from all types of background
radiation.This can be either stray light, thermal radiation, or any other source causing
uncorrelated photon counts.If the background is constant, i.e., independent of the photo-electron
count rate of the correlated photon stream coming from the light source, we measure the signal
strength (dark count rate) by blocking the light source.Regularly the average background count rate
$\dot{N}_\mathrm{bg}$ also depends on the average signal count rate $\dot{N}_\mathrm{intrinsic}$ of
the light source.We determine its strength with respect to the actual count rate present in the
experiment $\bar{N}_\mathrm{meas}$, as a superposition of the intrinsic signal (S) and Poisson dark
and background (B) from the environment \cite{chu_single_2017}.
Whenever there is a coincident two-photon event, either of the two photons stems from the light
source or the background.Only the combination of two photons from the light source will exhibit
correlations, for those photons due to the (anti)-bunching nature of the light source.The other
pairings, referring to two background photons, or one background photon and one photon of the light
source, do not contribute to the (anti)-bunching signal, as they occur randomly.Hence, we write the
measured correlation function as

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:g2_from_normalized_histogram}
%\setlength{\abovedisplayskip}{1pt}

\begin{alignat}
{3}
C_N(\tau,\, m)&=1+\dfrac{S^2}{\big(S+B\big)^2}\Big(g^{(2)}_\mathrm{intrinsic}-1\Big)\\
&=1+\rho^2\Big(g^{(2)}_\mathrm{intrinsic}-1\Big)\\
&=1+\nu_\mathrm{bg}\Big(g^{(2)}_\mathrm{intrinsic}-1\Big),
\end{alignat}

\setlength{\belowdisplayskip}{1pt}
\end{subequations}

where $S$ and $B$ are the mean signal and background \SIrange[range-units =
brackets]{6}{8}{\percent} in \cref{fig:Background}, respectively.
The fraction defines a factor $\nu_\mathrm{bg}\in[0,\,1]$ that denotes the decrease in overall
visibility dependent on the background signal, with the signal-to-background ratio
$\rho=\frac{S}{S+B}$ \cite{beveratos_room_2002}.
