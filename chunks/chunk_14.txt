For instance if the light field is already restricted to one spatial mode by using a high-NA
microscope with tight-focus aperture a, or an optical fiber entrance much smaller than the average
coherence cell at this position in the beam path.In such a case, the visibility of $g^{(2)}$ will
not be decreased for any given detector area.In the presented work, the spatial visibility reduction
is determined by the microscope focus size, since we use a radiation-shielded setup, even when
crossing larger apertures during propagation along z, no new modes are added that would reduce the
visibility.


\paragraph{Temporal Coherence Losses}\label{sec:temp_coh_loss} More restrictive boundaries are set in our experiments for preventing temporal coherence losses.In \cref{sec:spatial_coherence}, we derived the coherence length in space $l_c=c\tau_c$.Taking into account the spectral shape of $g^{(2)}$ from \cref{sec:lineshapes}, the size of the coherence cell is also given by the point at which the coincidence probability has decreased to the $1/e$ value.
If the detectors are separated by $\Delta r$, we sample the coherence properties in the temporal
coherence cell at position $\Delta r/c$, which defines the maximum $g^{(2)}$ value for any temporal
correlation measurement at $\tau_0$.Since the relative position of $\Delta r/c$ in the coherence
cell alters with coherence time $\tau_c$, the visibility $\nu_\mathrm{l_c}$ at a fixed $\Delta r$,
will also change for different light sources:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:g2coherencelosstemp}
\nu_\mathrm{l_c}^\mathrm{Lorentz}=e^{-\dfrac{\Delta r}{l_c}};\qquad\nu_\mathrm{l_c}^\mathrm{Gauss}=e^{-\Big(\dfrac{\Delta r}{l_c}\Big)^2}
\end{equation}

This finding is depicted in \cref{fig:g2_lcloss} for two different emitters with
$\tau_c=\SI{0.1}{\ns}$ and $\tau_c=\SI{1}{\ns}$, as well as for a Lorentzian (blue) and Gaussian
(red) lineshape.We see at the boarders of the coherence cells (green) for $\tau=\tau_c$, the
$g^{(2)}$ function and thus the visibility, has decreased to the $1/e$ value.Furthermore, it is
expressed, if $\Delta r$ is \SI{3}{cm} and \SI{30}{cm}, the values correspond to $l_c$ and the
visibility also reduces to the $1/e$ value.
\subparagraph{Summary} We elucidated, spatial and temporal coherence are similar concepts, but
differ in origin and strength of coherence loss for a given setup.The size of the temporal coherence
cell is defined by the source spectral extension and excited state lifetime.In this perspective, the
coherence time is given by the point at which the coincidence probability has decreased to the $1/e$
value.The coherence loss is dependent on the light source and amounts to a $1/e$-reduction if
$\Delta r$ is a few centimeters.
In contrast, the size of the spatial coherence cell is defined by the source's spatial
extension.Photons gain coherence for longer propagation distances z and by passing tiny apertures
which filter spatial modes (cf.\cref{eq:g2spatial3}).The coherence radius is thereby not the
$1/e$-value of $J_1$, but the first zero of $J_1$.The coherence loss is independent of the light
source and negligible for small apertures or large distances to the detector pair.


\subsubsection{Quantum Statistical Reduction of the Visibility}\label{sec:beamsplittercorr}
The statistical behavior of photons at a \ac{BS} elucidates some of the most fundamental quantum
phenomena such as quantum superposition and
randomness \cite{weihs_photon_2001}.
Nevertheless, experiments often fail to detect the same rates on the start and stop detectors.For a
loss-free \ac{BS} ($p_2=1-p_1$), there are trivial reasons, such as an unequal \ac{BS} ratio
$p_1:p_2\neq 0.5:0.5$ or an unequal dead time for the detectors, where not all events are registered
on one detector.In any case, light statistics from the source and photon bunching never affect the
proportion of light detected at the start and stop detectors at equilibrium conditions $(\tau,\,
t\gg\tau_c)$.While from the view point of classical physics a \ac{BS} is a rather simple device, its
operation becomes highly non-trivial when we consider quantum behavior as for correlation
measurements.
