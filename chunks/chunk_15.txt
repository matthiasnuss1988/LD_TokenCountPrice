Therefore we ask "How does a \ac{BS} act on two particle incidents simultaneously and how does the
interaction influence photon bunching measurements?".First we consider a balanced \ac{BS}
($p_2=p_1$), where one photon is incident via route (0) (\cref{fig:g2_beamsplitter}).The photon has
a 50\% chance of ending up in either port (1) or in port \textcolor{red}{(2)}.Quantum mechanically
we write the operation of the \ac{BS} using states $\ket{0},\,\ket{1}$ and
$\ket{\textcolor{red}{2}}$ as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bs}
\ket{0}\rightarrow\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{1}+i\ket{\textcolor{red}{2}})
\end{equation}

For simplicity we assumed, the \ac{BS} as completely symmetric.This symmetry implies that a wave
experiences a phase shift of $\pi/2$ upon reflection relative to transmission
\cite{weihs_photon_2001}, as signified by the phase factor $i$ in \cref{eq:bs}.If we envisage a
continuous stream of photons equidistant in time and incident from beam port (0), then the detectors
positioned in outgoing beams (1) and \textcolor{red}{(2)} will each register a random sequence of
photons, as each single-photon has the same probability to be detected either in (1) or in
\textcolor{red}{(2)}.This is a direct consequence of the probabilistic interpretation of the quantum
state in \cref{eq:bs}.In other words the introduction of a \ac{BS} introduces new noise in the
outgoing beams, degrading the statistics.\\
For two incident photons, as depicted in \cref{fig:g2_beamsplitter}, the operation of the \ac{BS}
reads:

\begin{align}
\ket{0}_1 \ket{0}_{\textcolor{red}{2}}&\quad\rightarrow\quad\dfrac{1}{2}(\ket{1}_1+i\ket{\textcolor{red}{2}}_1)(\ket{1}_{\textcolor{red}{2}}+i\ket{\textcolor{red}{2}}_{\textcolor{red}{2}})\\
&\quad\rightarrow\quad\dfrac{1}{2}(\ket{1}_1\ket{1}_{\textcolor{red}{2}}+i\ket{1}_1\ket{\textcolor{red}{2}}_{\textcolor{red}{2}}+i\ket{\textcolor{red}{2}}_1\ket{1}_{\textcolor{red}{2}}-\ket{\textcolor{red}{2}}_1\ket{\textcolor{red}{2}}_{\textcolor{red}{2}}),
\end{align}

with the index addressing the initial photon.Each of the two photons behaves independently just as
classical particles would do, but end up with different probabilities in the states $\ket{1}$ and
$\ket{\textcolor{red}{2}}$.Although, in a coincidence-based $g^{(2)}$ experiment, it is essential to
detect all coincidence events at $\tau=0$, to allow the most accurate $g^{(2)}(0)$ evaluation and
classification of the light source.We will intimate that besides the adding of new noise, a \ac{BS}
introduces an error in the determination of $g^{(2)}(0)$, which is severe, even if $p_1\neq p_2$ and
must be considered.\\
Let us have a look at n-bunching photons passing through a \ac{BS}.In \cref{fig:tree_dagram} we see
a tree diagram, where each of the $n\leq4$ bunching photon passes through a \ac{BS} to a start (1)
and a stop detector \textcolor{red}{(2)}, with each photon having probability $p_1$ or $p_2$ to
reach ether detector.In the case of one photon $(n=1)$, the photon goes ether to the start detector
with $p_1$ or to the stop detector with $p_2$.The more photons bundle, the greater the number of
possible branches of the tree diagram, which scales with $2^n$.Here, $\mathrm{P_i}$ denotes
the product path probability of a branch.We can see from the diagram that for a detection scheme
where a start event must be followed by an event at the stop detector to allow coincidence counting,
the event counts at which the first photon arrives at the stop detector are lost (dashed lines),
already introducing an error.In our detection system, the order of start and stop detector is not
fixed, but where the photon arrives first is taken into account.However, bunching/antibunching is
only detected correctly if the \ac{BS} always directs at least one photon to the stop detector when
several photons are bunched.This is because the counter cannot distinguish whether one or more
photons arrive at the same time and only delivers one coincidence count.
A \ac{BS} does not fulfill this criterion for $n>1$, as you can see from the paths marked in red,
where all the bundled photons are directed to only one detector and consequently no coincidence
event is detected.
