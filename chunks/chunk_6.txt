Comparing the experimental baseline fluctuations with $\sigma_\mathrm{g^{(2)}}$ is a good criterion
to judge whether the baseline is stable during measurement.


\subsubsection{Normalization for a CW Light Source}
To calculate $g^{(2)}$ for a \ac{CW} light source, the measured histogram data $c(\tau)$ is first
normalized to the Poisson baseline \cite{beveratos_room_2002,swabian_instruments_time_2021}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cwNormg2}
C^\mathrm{CW}_N(\tau)=\dfrac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{bin}\dot{N}_\mathrm{start}\dot{N}_\mathrm{stop}T_t}c(\tau)
\end{equation}

After normalization, a photon source with Poisson photon statistics, i.e.a laser,
$C^\mathrm{CW}_N(\tau)$ has a constant value of one, regardless of the time difference.Thermal light
sources with super-Poisson statistics exhibit values that are larger than one.For times other than
zero, the function also approaches one.\Cref{fig:g2cwpulsed}a points out such a normalization for a
\ac{NV} center in a nanocrystal.The zero-time value of the uncorrected normalized correlation
function given by cref{eq:cwNormg2} is $C^{CW}_N(0)$ = \num{0.17}.The fit is performed with the
model derived in \cref{sec:decon}.\newline
Anyway, the coincidence-based method also has some drawbacks.When a second photon arrives shortly
after the first one, the second photon cannot be detected and a second detector is needed, due to
the dead time $\tau_D$ after each detected photon.It takes about \SIlist{57;97}{\ns} (in this
thesis) until the signal can reach the threshold again.Furthermore, photon bunching effects on
\si{ps}-scales are impossible to detect with only one detector in photon counting mode.The method
that suits better to the specific situation depends on many factors and should be considered well.


\subsubsection{Normalization for a Pulsed Light Source}
If light originates from a pulsed photon source (\cref{fig:g2cwpulsed}b and not from a continuously
emitting photon source (\cref{fig:g2cwpulsed}a, we need a different approach for evaluating
$g^{(2)}$.The time-difference histogram of a pulsed light source has prominent peaks for each pulse
in the observed time span, where the peak at $\tau=0$ vanishes for a single-photon source.Here, the
coincidences between peaks do not reach zero, because of the overlapping of adjacent peaks.
Contrary to a continuous light source, only histogram values for certain discrete time differences,
i.e., integer multiples of the distance between pulses are reasonable.To obtain the normalized
histogram value $C^\mathrm{ml}_N(m)$ for each pulse $m$, we divide the area of any given pulse by
the Poisson limit, which would be obtained for that pulsed source.\cite{beveratos_room_2002}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mlNormg2}
C^\mathrm{ml}_N(m)=\dfrac{f}{\dot{N}_\mathrm{start}\dot{N}_\mathrm{stop}T_t}c(m),\qquad \textrm{with}\qquad c(m)=\sum_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon}c(\tau)\textrm{ \cite{santori_triggered_2001}}
\end{equation}

We sum up the histogram $c(\tau)$ in a range $2\epsilon$ around each pulse center.We choose
$\epsilon$ to obtain an accurate area result in a range of three standard deviations $(3\sigma)$ of
the pulse.Thereafter, the normalization is similar to the \ac{CW} case, but since all data in the
bin of a pulse are collated into one value, the normalization is independent of $\tau_\mathrm{bin}$,
but utilizes the pulse frequency $f$.


\subsection{Different Lineshapes}\label{sec:lineshapes}
Time resolution is the key to measure a signal within a reasonable time frame.A quantitative view on
this issue is taken in \cref{sec:Timeestimation}.
Fortunately, most signals, e.g., from single molecules are well resolvable, due to
lifetime-broadening in the \si{\ps}- to \si{\ns}-range.Let us first consider $g^{(2)}$ for different
spectral line shapes.


\subsubsection{Rectangular Filter}
As an example imagine an optical filter only passing frequencies in a range
$[\omega_0-\frac{\Delta\omega}{2},\,\omega_0+\frac{\Delta\omega}{2}]$ around the central frequency
$\omega_0$ of the signal with a bandwidth $\Delta\omega$.
