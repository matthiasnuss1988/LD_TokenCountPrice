These conditions are coherent ($g^{(2)}$ = \num{0}) and bunched light sources
($g^{(2)}>$\num{1}).The intensity fluctuations in \cref{eq:g2classical} are always positive and
anti-bunched states with $g^{(2)}<1$ cannot be reached.
Any state for which $g^{(2)}(0) < 1$ is said to be nonclassical according to the antibunching
criterion.As an example, a Fock state $\ket{n}$ has $g^{(2)}(0) =1-1/n$, whereas for a thermal
state, $g^{(2)}(0)=2$.\\
Analogous to $I(t)\propto\braket{\hat{a}^\dagger(t)\hat{a}(t)}$, which gives the probability to
detect a photon at the time
$t$, $g^{(2)}$ can be interpreted as a conditional probability:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:g2def4}
g^{(2)}(\tau)=\dfrac{P(t|t+\tau)}{P(t)}
\end{equation}

$P(t)$ is the probability of detecting a photon at time $t$ and $P(t|t+\tau)$ the conditional
probability of detecting a second photon at time $t + \tau$, if the first photon was detected.


\paragraph{Remark on $\hat{Q}(\tau)$} We emphasize our finding: The difference between the classical description and the quantum mechanical description of $g^{(2)}$, is a limited definition range of the normalized Mandel Q-parameter (compare the last parts of \cref{eq:g2classical,eq:g2quantum}.Furthermore, motivated by the similarity of the last part in \cref{eq:g2quantum,eq:g2def6}, it will be shown via the Wiener--Khinchin theorem and the Siegert relation (\cref{sec:siegert}), for light sources with Lorentzian and Gaussian-shaped spectral density functions, $\hat{Q}(\tau)$ can be factorized:\\ $\hat{Q}(\tau)=\hat{Q}_0 f(\tau)$, where $f(\tau)=\exp(-\alpha|\tau-\tau_0|)$ is an exponential scaling function \cite{ann_observation_2019}.


\section{Data Analysis and Derivations}
The goal is to deduce an analysis method that creates a graph from the time-tagging experiment that
can be interpreted as the intrinsic function $g^{(2)}$ of the light source.


\subsection{Time Difference Spectra: Finite Sampling}
Although there is no natural quantization of $t$ in $g^{(2)}$, it is in the measurement due to time
binning.This yields an adaptation of "nature" to the experiment.A second problem is the
interpretation of \textit{intensity}.Again, in a natural system, there is no limit and no
quantization of intensity.It is a continuous curve evaluated in time.However, the only thing one can
obtain from the measurement is whether
there is a photon time stamp or not.There is also no information about the number of photons.

\begin{itemize}
\item The former continuous time $t$ is quantized by the minimum binwidth $\tau_\mathrm{bin}$ = \SI{1}{\ps} form the \textit{Swabian Instruments Time Tagger Ultra}.This also holds for the time difference $\tau$.
\item The intensity $I(t)$ at a time $t$ consists of only two states: $I(t) = 1$ if there is a photon, $I(t) = 0$ if there is none.
\end{itemize}

What do these perceptions mean to the numerator of \cref{eq:g2classical}?Now, averaging over the
product $I(t)I(t + \tau)$ is not integrating, but summarizing this expression over all possible time
tags:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:g2finite1}
\int_{t}I(t)I(t+\tau)\partial t\quad\Rightarrow\quad\sum_t I(t)I(t+\tau)
\end{equation}

The sum argument is the product of two intensities, which can only be \num{0} or \num{1}.The sum
over all time bins t at a given time difference $\tau$ returns the absolute number of coincidences.


\subsection{Normalization of \texorpdfstring{$\boldsymbol{g^{(2)}}$}{g2 Function}}
A spectrum exhibiting the number of coincidences for each time difference $\tau$ is already very
close to the intrinsic $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ function.It must be normalized, which is done by the
denominator in \cref{eq:g2classical}.Nevertheless in a real measurement, due to background
contribution and convolution with the \ac{IRF} of the setup, there is still a difference between
this spectrum $c_N(\tau)$ and $g^{(2)}$.
That is why, in general, a distinction is made between $c_N(\tau)$ and $g^{(2)}$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:g2finite2}
\braket{I(t)I(t+\tau)}=\dfrac{1}{\mathrm{N}}\sum_\mathrm{i=1}^\mathrm{N}I(t_i)I(t_i+\tau)\qquad \textrm{and}\qquad \braket{I(t)}^2=\Big(\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_\mathrm{i=1}^\mathrm{N} I(t_i)\Big)^2
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the total number of bins ($T_t/\tau_\mathrm{bin}$).
