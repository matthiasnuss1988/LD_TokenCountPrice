Tt is not applicable to fit every peak element-wise with the peak shape, since the cross-correlation
terms for $m\neq0$ have to be considered.~For instance, the \ac{FWHM} of a Gauss and Lorentz shaped
histogram depends on the actual pulse number $l$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GaussLorentzPulsedFWHM}
\mathrm{FWHM}=	\begin{cases}
\textrm{\textbf{Gauss: }}\dfrac{2l}{f}+2\tau_0-2\sigma\sqrt{2\ln(2)} & l\in[-m,m] \\
\textrm{\textbf{Lorentz: }}\dfrac{2l}{f}+2\tau_0-2\sigma & l\in[-m,m]\\
\end{cases}

\end{equation}

the number of pulses $m$ and the laser repetition rate $f$.The $\sigma$-values have to be extracted
by this formulae.Direct convolution for more complex peak functions gets tedious, the more pulses in
the histogram.Nevertheless, one can continue any pulse function by using a convolution property of
the delta distribution.If we look at the continuous continuation of the delta distribution (shah
function), the convolution of any function with the shah function is the continuous continuation of
the function itself.We fit the histogram with \cref{eq:sha_continuation}, for a Lorentz shape and
average the extracted jitter values from each pulse.

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:sha_all}
\setlength{\abovedisplayskip}{1pt}

\begin{alignat}
{2}
&\left.\sh\right._{\frac{1}{f}} (\tau)=\lim_{m\to\infty} \sum_{l=-m}^m\delta(\tau-\dfrac{l}{f})\label{eq:sha}\\
&\big(\left.\sh\right._{\frac{1}{f}}\circledast \mathrm{IRF}\big)(\tau)=\lim_{m\to\infty} \sum_{l=-m}^m \mathrm{IRF}(\tau-\dfrac{l}{f})\label{eq:sha_continuation}
\end{alignat}

\setlength{\belowdisplayskip}{1pt}
\end{subequations}

We summarize, a Lorentz fit leads to reliable results for $\sigma_\mathrm{sys}$, especially in the
low counting regime.This also makes sense from the perspective that a Lorentz shape is the reverse
Fourier-transform of two mirror-symmetric exponential decays (cf.\cref{sec:Impact}), which relates
to convolution with exponential broadening mechanism here.


\subsection{Fluorescence Lifetime Determination}\label{sec:lifetime}
Fluorescence lifetimes are typically measured by \ac{TCSPC} with an \ac{HBT} setup
\cite{miyauchiFemtosecondExcitationCorrelation2009}.In second-order coincidence histograms from a
pulsed source, we find redundant information.As we have discussed for temporal modes
(\cref{sec:g2_temp_modes}), the fluorescence lifetime is fingerprinted in the extracted values of
the peak areas, if we follow virtually the temporal trend, but $\tau_c$ and thus the fluorescence
lifetime $\tau_f$ is also imprinted in the individual histogram peak curvatures.
In the followong discussion we call the right side of each pulse "emission" side and the left side
"absorption" side, due to their physical origin.In a pulsed measurement the extraction of $\tau_c$
during a reconvolution-fit is hard due to the lack of data points in the correlation regime close to
$m,\,\tau=0$.Contrary, we have to assume a value of $\tau_c $ for the fit to converge.\\
Fortunately $\tau_c$ is imprinted in the curvature of the emission side
\cite{kollner_how_1992,sunney_xie_single-molecule_2002} of each pulse.An exponential probability
density function \cite{santori_triggered_2001,beveratos_room_2002} is most widely used to model the
decay curve of the fluorescence lifetime.To get a correct and useful envelope for the re-convolution
routine, we will take similar considerations into account as in the discussion of the \ac{IRF} in
\cref{sec:powerjitter}.The procedure will also include a backup mechanism: As expressed in
\cref{fig:g2_lifetime}, we fit the histograms with an envelope function (green), extract $\tau_c$
for each pulse and average the obtained $m$ values for better statistics.Second, we also obtain the
criterion for the $1/e$ value of each peak from the envelope function.We calculate the $1/e$-
amplitude value and the corresponding $\tau_\mathrm{1/e}$ value (intersection with the $\tau$-axis)
from the raw histogram values.We extract $\tau_c$ from the $\tau_\mathrm{1/e}$-values as outlined in
\cref{sisec:lifetime} with the criterion of the envelope function .
